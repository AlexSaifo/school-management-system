## Architecture Highlights

- **Microservices-like API structure** with Next.js API routes
- **Context-based state management** for authentication and UI state
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **JWT-based authentication** with role-based access control
- **Real-time communication** using Socket.IO
- **Internationalization** with client-side language switching
- **Responsive Material-UI components** with custom theming
- **Docker containerization** for easy deployment

## Database Design

The system uses PostgreSQL with a normalized schema featuring:

- **User inheritance pattern** (Base User ‚Üí Role-specific tables)
- **Academic hierarchy** (Academic Year ‚Üí Semester ‚Üí Class ‚Üí Students)
- **Flexible relationships** (Many-to-many for complex associations)
- **Audit trails** with created/updated timestamps
- **Soft deletes** via status enums where applicable

## Security Features

- **Password hashing** with bcryptjs
- **JWT token authentication** with expiration
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Input validation** with Zod schemas
- **SQL injection prevention** via Prisma ORM
- **XSS protection** with Next.js built-in security
- **CSRF protection** via SameSite cookies

## Performance Optimizations

- **Database indexing** on frequently queried fields
- **Lazy loading** for large datasets with pagination
- **Caching strategies** for static data
- **Optimized queries** with Prisma's query optimization
- **Code splitting** with Next.js dynamic imports
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component

## Development Practices

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Git** for version control
- **Docker** for environment consistency
- **Comprehensive testing** (unit and integration tests)
- **Documentation-driven development**
